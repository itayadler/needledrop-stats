## What is this?

A calculated approach to finding great music to listen to by !(theneedledrop.com)[http://theneedledrop.com].

## WIP

[x] - Build a scraper that gets all the reviews data (rank, date, youtube id).
[ ] - Create a site that offers visualizations and a quick search for reviews.

## DIY

- `npm install`
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key node index.js //by default outputs to reviews.json`

Note: You will need a Google Developer project running in order to obtain a valid youtube api-key.
